Contribution
============

Contributions are essential to the success of open source projects, but are by
no means limited to contributing code. Much more can be done, for example by
improving [documentation](https://docs.typo3.org/p/sbuerk/t3e-legacy-param-guard/main/en-us/>)
or answering questions on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/legacy-param-guard>).

For details on the contribution workflow and rules have a look into the [contribution documentation](Documentation/Introduction/Contribution.rst)
and the [commit message rules](Documentation/Introduction/Contribution/CommitMessageRules.rst).
